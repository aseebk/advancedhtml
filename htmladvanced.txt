HTML ADVANCED
---------------
*HTML5 adds and amends a handful of tags relating to text. Many of the minor amendments, such as differing attributes in existing tags
   time and mark tag
   The <mark> tag in HTML is used to define the marked text. It is used to highlight the part of the text in a paragraph. 
   The <time> tag defines a specific time (or datetime).

Tables: Columns, Headers, and Footers
--------------------
 *The <thead> tag in HTML is used to create a table header and usually appears after the <colgroup> or <caption> tags and it should appear before the <tbody> and <tfoot> tag.

            <table>
              <colgroup>
                <col>
                   <col class="alternative">
                   <col>
               </colgroup>
*thead, tfoot and tbody allow you to separate the table into header, footer and body, which can be handy when dealing with larger tables.

The Div Align Attribute

The <div align=""> attribute is used for aligning the text in a div tag to The Left, Right, center or justify.

The Font Color Attribute

HTML5 Audio 
-----------
audio files had to be played in a browser using a plug-in like Adobe Flash. 

 Semantic Elements
 -----------------
 Semantic HTML elements clearly describe itâ€™s meaning in a human and machine readable way. Elements such as <header>, <footer> and <article> are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.

 *The <hgroup> element should be used where you want a main heading with one or more subheadings.
